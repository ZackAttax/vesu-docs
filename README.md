# Vesu Documentation

The Vesu Documentation website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

### Requirements

Make sure you have `Node.js` version 18.0 or higher installed. 

Follow the instructions [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) if you need to install `Node.js`.

### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project's root folder and install all project dependencies.

```bash
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

Start a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

```bash
$ npm run start
```

### Build Project

Generate static content into the `build` directory that can be served using any static contents hosting service.

```

```

Note, this command should be tested prior to pushing any update to GitHub.
