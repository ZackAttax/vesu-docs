In this section, we'll learn how to create new Vesu markets.

While the Vesu lending protocol allows everyone to create new markets permissionelssly, this feature is initially not supported on the website. The reason for that is to limit the risks for users during the first weeks after mainnet launch.

:::warning
Vesu's permissionless nature enables everyone to create new lending pools calling the respective protocol function directly (e.g. through a block explorer). However, this is discouraged until this feature is fully supported on the Vesu website.
