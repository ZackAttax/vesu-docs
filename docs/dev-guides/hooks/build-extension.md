You can build your own hooks by writing an extension contract that implements the extension interface.

With these many functions to plug into, you can customize basically all possible actions that are important in a lending pool opening up new possibilities such as automated position management, advanced liquidation options, KYC-ed and RWA pools etc.

See [/dev-guides/extension](../extension.md)
for the full interface.
