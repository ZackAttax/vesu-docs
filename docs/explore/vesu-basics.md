In here, we dive into some basic concepts you'd come across whilst interacting with the Vesu protocol.

### Liquidity Pooling

Liquidity pooling simply explained refers to the process of providing liquidity to a lending pool/market.

It involves individuals like yourself contributing their funds to a liquidity pool to facilitate trading and other financial activities within Vesu.

### Overcollateralized Lending

Overcollaterized lending is a lending model in decentralized finance where borrowers are required to provide collateral that exceeds the value of the borrowed funds. i.e users deposit nore assets than the amounts they wish to borrow to mitigate risks and ensure the safety of lenders' funds.

### Loan-to-Value Ratio

The Loan-to-Value Ratio is a financial metric used to express the ratio of a loan amount to the appraised value or market value of the collateral asset. 

The LTV ratio is a crucial factor in assessing the risk of a loan. A higher LTV ratio indicates a higher risk for the lenders, as it means the loan is a larger portion of the asset's value and vice versa.

### Lending Pair

Lending pair simply refers to a pair of assets in a lending pool.

### Lending Pool

Lending pools are compartmentalized lending facilities where risks are shared among depositors of a certain asset in a pool, but are strictly isolated across one another.

Whilst lending pools can comprise of uni-directional lending pairs, they also support the creation of more complex lending configurations as a composition of various lending pairs.

Lending pools in Vesu are configured in such a way that the assets supplied in a lending pool serve as shared liquidity across all associated lending pairs, allowing for maximal capital efficiency. At the same time, this liquidity is not accessible to other Lending markets, thereby compartmentalizing risks across pools.

The diagram above, depicts a variety of lending market containing different lending pair configurations from simple uni-directional lending pairs (pool A), to reverse lending pairs (pool B) and even multi-collaterized lending pairs (pool C).

### Position

In the context of the financial market, a "position" simply refers to an individual or entity's ownership or exposure to a financial asset or investment.

### Lend APY

The Lend APY refers to the annual percentage yield accrued to the lender from providing funds to the lending pool.

### Borrow APR

The Borrow APR refers to the annual percentage interest rate that borrowers pay for accessing funds in a lending pool.

### Liquidation

Liquidation in lending markets refers to the process through which a borrower's collateral is sold or liquidated to repay a portion or all of their outstanding debt when the value of the collateral falls below a certain threshold.
