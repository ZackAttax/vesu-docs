# Get Started

Vesu is a fully open and permissionless lending protocol built on [Starknet](https://starknet.io). Users can supply crypto assets (earn), borrow crypto assets and build new lending experiences on Vesu without relying on intermediaries. Vesu is built as a public infrastructure free for everyone to use.
