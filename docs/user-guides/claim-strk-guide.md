In this guide you'll be taught how to claim STRK tokens earned from the DeFi Spring rewards.

Make sure you are connected to the app before you proceed. See how [here](./connect-guide.md).

### Claim STRK rewards

To get started, ensure you already have an open position on Vesu, as that is what qualifies you for STRK rewards. Please go through the [DeFi Spring section](../explore/defi-spring.md) for more information.

To claim your STRK rewards:

1. Head over to your Vesu positions [Vesu](https://vesu.xyz/positions)

2. Just above your positions, you can see a dedicated DeFi Spring section. "Earned STRK" represents the STRKs you've accrued over time. "Claimable STRK" is the amount you can claim.
